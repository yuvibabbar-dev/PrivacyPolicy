  <h1>Lane Flow – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective: <strong>November 26, 2025</strong></p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not require an account or collect personal data to use the app.</li>
    <li>Session data (lanes, swimmers, timers, history) is stored locally on your device.</li>
    <li>Purchases are processed by Apple via In‑App Purchase; receipts may be verified by RevenueCat.</li>
    <li>No third-party ad SDKs are included; the app may show ads using Apple-approved frameworks only.</li>
    <li>You control exports; CSV exports are generated locally and shared only when you choose.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data We Handle</h2>
  <p><strong>Local app data:</strong> Lanes, swimmer labels, timers, history, and preferences are stored on your device. Clearing app data or uninstalling removes this information.</p>
  <p><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Apple processes payments. We use RevenueCat to manage entitlements and verify App Store receipts. RevenueCat may receive anonymized identifiers (e.g., app user ID) to maintain your subscription status.</p>
  <p><strong>Analytics/ads:</strong> We do not include third-party analytics SDKs. If ads are shown, they are limited to Apple-approved frameworks and do not use custom tracking.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your data. Subscription status may be shared with Apple (IAP) and RevenueCat solely to manage purchases and access.</p>

  <h2>Exports and Sharing</h2>
  <p>Exports (e.g., CSV) are created locally and shared only when you initiate them through the system share sheet or file save dialogs.</p>

  <h2>Retention and Deletion</h2>
  <p>All session data is kept on your device. To remove it, delete app data or uninstall the app. Subscription records managed by Apple/RevenueCat are retained as required for purchase validation.</p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>The app is not directed to children under 13.</p>
